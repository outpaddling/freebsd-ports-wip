SortMeRNA is a program tool for filtering, mapping and OTU-picking NGS reads
in metatranscriptomic and metagenomic data. The core algorithm is based on
approximate seeds and allows for fast and sensitive analyses of nucleotide
sequences. The main application of SortMeRNA is filtering ribosomal RNA from
metatranscriptomic data. Additional applications include OTU-picking and
taxonomy assignation available through QIIME v1.9+.
