Sailfish, a software tool that implements a novel, alignment-free algorithm for
the estimation of isoform abundances directly from a set of reference sequences
and RNA-seq reads. Rather than working at the read level, the fundamental unit
of transcript coverage in Sailfish is the k-mer. Implementing this alternative,
lightweight, approach allows Sailfish to dispense with many of the complexities
of read mapping while remaining robust to sequencing errors. By replacing read
mapping with intelligent k-mer indexing and counting, Sailfish is able to
quantify isoform abundance orders of magnitude faster than existing tools.
