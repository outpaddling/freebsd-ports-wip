LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size) determines the features
(organisms, clades, operational taxonomic units, genes, or functions) most
likely to explain differences between classes by coupling standard tests for
statistical significance with additional tests encoding biological consistency
and effect relevance.
