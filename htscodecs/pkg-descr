Custom CRAM codecs used for "EXTERNAL" block types. These consist of
two variants of the rANS codec (8-bit and 16-bit renormalisation, with
run-length encoding and bit-packing also supported in the latter), a
dynamic arithmetic coder, and custom codecs for name/ID compression and
quality score compression derived from fqzcomp.
