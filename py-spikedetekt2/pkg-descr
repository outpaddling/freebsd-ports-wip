The KlustaSuite is an open source spike sorting software suite designed for
extracellular recordings obtained with large multielelectrode arrays (with
hundreds of channels).
The KlustaSuite contains three programs:
SpikeDetekt for detecting and extracting spikes from raw recordings
(written in Python).
KlustaKwik for automatically clustering the detected spikes (written in C++).
KlustaViewa for manually processing the results of the automatic step
(written in Python).
