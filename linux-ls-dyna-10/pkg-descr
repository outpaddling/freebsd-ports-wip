LS-DYNA is a general-purpose finite element program capable of simulating
complex real world problems. It is used by the automobile, aerospace,
construction, military, manufacturing, and bioengineering industries. LS-DYNA is
optimized for shared and distributed memory Unix, Linux, and Windows based,
platforms, and it is fully QA'd by LSTC. The code's origins lie in highly
nonlinear, transient dynamic finite element analysis using explicit time
integration.
