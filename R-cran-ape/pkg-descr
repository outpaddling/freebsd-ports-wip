Functions for reading, writing, plotting, and manipulating phylogenetic trees,
analyses of comparative data in a phylogenetic framework, ancestral character
analyses, analyses of diversification and macroevolution, computing distances
from DNA sequences, reading and writing nucleotide sequences as well as
importing from BioConductor, and several tools such as Mantel's test,
generalized skyline plots, graphical exploration of phylogenetic data (alex,
trex, kronoviz), estimation of absolute evolutionary rates and clock-like
trees using mean path lengths and penalized likelihood, dating trees with
non-contemporaneous sequences, translating DNA into AA sequences, and
assessing sequence alignments. Phylogeny estimation can be done with the NJ,
BIONJ, ME, MVR, SDM, and triangle methods, and several methods handling
incomplete distance matrices (NJ*, BIONJ*, MVR*, and the corresponding
triangle method). Some functions call external applications (PhyML, Clustal,
T-Coffee, Muscle) whose results are returned into R.
