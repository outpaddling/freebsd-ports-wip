MetagenomeSeq is designed to determine features (be it Operational Taxanomic
Unit (OTU), species, etc.) that are differentially abundant between two or
more groups of multiple samples. metagenomeSeq is designed to address the
effects of both normalization and under-sampling of microbial communities on
disease association detection and the testing of feature correlations.
