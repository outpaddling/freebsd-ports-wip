Rarefaction analyzer is a simple program that can be used to perform rarefaction
analysis. This analysis is particularly useful when you wish to know the
fraction of the target population that is captured in your sequence data versus
the fraction of the target population that has not been described due to not
sequencing deep enough. This is a standard analysis performed for microbiome
research and is typically recommended for any kind of metagenomics where counts
are of interest. Input to this tool includes a FASTA formatted reference
database, a SAM formatted alignment file, and a CSV formatted annoation
database.
